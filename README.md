- 💻 Hi, I’m @Ivan, a curious and enthusiastic newbie in the world of coding and tech!
- 🔍 I’m interested in learning more about web development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers and excited to explore them.
- 📚 I’m currently learning  Python. I'm also dipping my toes into machine learning and data analysis.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve building simple web applications, chatbots, or data visualization tools. I'm eager to work with others who share my passion for learning and creating something new.
- 📲 How to reach me: You can find me on GitHub (obviously!), and in tg @garogarof. Feel free to send me a message or connect with me - I'd love to chat about tech, coding, or anything else that interests you!
- 🔮 Fun fact: In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction novels, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I'm also a big fan of space exploration and hope to one day visit Mars (or at least see humans set foot on the Red Planet!) 🛰️
